# slack-calc-bot
Bot for Slack that evaluates arithmetic expressions. Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`, `ร`), division (`\`, `รท`), exponentiation (`^`) (use exponentiation for square roots & other roots) & parenthesis (`(`, `)`).

## Setup
### On Slack side
- Create a new application at https://api.slack.com/apps using the template manifest @ [slack-manifest.yml](slack-manifest.yml) filling in the following details:
  - `<URL-TO-YOUR-APP>`: can be either ngrok URL for development or wherever you're hosting the app (.e.g Heroku)
- Note down the 'Signing Secret' given on the 'Basic Information' page for the application (should be of form `https://api.slack.com/apps/<some-app-id>/general?`)
- Install application to your workspace & note down the `Bot User OAuth Token` on the 'Install App' page for the app (should be of form `https://api.slack.com/apps/<some-app-id>/install-on-team?`)

### On your machine/server
- Install Ruby.
- Install Bundler - `gem install bundler`
- Clone this repo
- If you'd like to use Heroku to run the bot, skip the next 3 steps and jump down to 'Heroku Setup'
- From the repo directory, run `bundle install`
- Set two environment variables as follows from the Slack information we noted down earlier:
   - SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=<Signing Secret noted down from the 'Basic Information' page on Slack>
   - SLACK_BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Bot User OAuth Token noted down from the 'Install App' page on Slack>
- Run the Rails application via `bundle exec rails server`

### Heroku setup
- This assumes you have the heroku toolbelt installed on your machine & are set up with credentials for Heroku. Check here if you need to set it up - [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
- From the repo directory, run `heroku create`
- Run `heroku config:set SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=<Signing Secret noted down from the 'Basic Information' page on Slack>`
- Run `heroku config:set SLACK_BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Bot User OAuth Token noted down from the 'Install App' page on Slack>`
- Push the repo to Heroku via `git push heroku master`
- You should see that Heroku successfully deploys your bot

### Back on Slack
- Navigate to the 'App Manfiest' page for your app (should be of form `https://app.slack.com/app-settings/<some-id>/<some-id>/app-manifest`)
- You'll see a message at the top regarding your request URL not being verified, go ahead and verify the URL. As long as you did the previous block properly on your machine/server, the verification should be successful.

You're all set to start messaging the app/bot. Invite the bot to your channel & highlight it with arithmetic expressions. Direct messages to the application also work.

## Tests
This assumes you've completed the `On your machine/server` section above. To execute tests run `bundle exec rspec`.
